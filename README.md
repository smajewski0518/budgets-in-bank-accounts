### Banking Budgets Use Cases

**Create a Savings Goal**: The user can define a new savings goal by giving it a **name** (e.g., "New Kayak"), a **target amount** (e.g., $300), and an optional **target date**.

**View Goals Dashboard**: The user can see a list of all their active goals. Each goal displays its name, the target amount, the current amount saved, and a **progress bar** showing the percentage complete.

**Progress Bar** The progress bar will show the total amount, the amount that is still required, and the frequency required to make the goal buy specified date. There will be a progress bar for each specific goal and another progress bar to show the sum all goals.

**Contribute to a Goal**: The user can log a new contribution to a specific goal. For example, add $50 to the "New Kayak" goal. Or the user can designate an amount to savings (e.g. $50) and the program will calculate the percentage of the amount to designate to each goal based on total budgets and selected "by date".

**View Contribution History**: The user can see a historical log of all contributions made to a specific goal, including the date and amount of each contribution.

**Archive a Goal**: The user can move a completed or cancelled goal to an "archived" list to keep the main dashboard clean.
